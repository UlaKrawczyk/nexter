### This is a simple webpage created during the Udemy course to practise css grid:
* using css grid for main layout
* adding minor grids for smaller components
* matching different row and column track sizes for different types of content
* mixing css grid with flex-box
* css grid gallery
* pseudoelements as grid items

### Page is responsive by:
* writing grid which is responsive without any media queries eg. section features
* adding media queries and correct units
* changing layout at certain breakpoints
* desktop first technique
